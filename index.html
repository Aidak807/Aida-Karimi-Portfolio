           <h2> Discover my work and skills</h2>
            <p >As a UX/ UI designer with a unique blend of architecture, fashion design, and sales experience, I bring a holistic approach to crafting user-centric digital experiences. My background in architecture has sharpened my problem-solving and spatial design skills, enabling me to think critically and approach challenges with structured creativity. My expertise in fashion design enhances my attention to detail, aesthetics, and visual storytelling, while my sales experience has given me a deep understanding of customer behavior, empathy, and communication.

            This diverse skill set allows me to design intuitive and visually compelling interfaces that not only meet user needs but also align with business goals. I am passionate about merging functionality with beauty, creating designs that inspire, engage, and deliver meaningful user experiences.</p>
